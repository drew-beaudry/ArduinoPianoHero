# ArduinoPianoHero
The source code for a very fun project! Using Arduino and many physical components, I created a toy which allows the user to select a song and follow along using 5 different large light-up keys which light up to indicate to the user the next note in the song. A free-play mode is the default when not in song mode, allowing the user to play 5 keys which light up upon pressing and play the notes C5-G5 in the C Major scale. 

Included is the source code, PowerPoint presentation, and circuit diagram.
